## Project Description
This is my second indepentent project to showcase the lesson learned last week: Introduction to Programming: Javascript and JQuery. This project uses branching to return the result, JQuery is used to show and hide the result, form gathers input from the user, variable names are descriptive of what they represent and the web page is styled using custom CSS.

## Notes
* I googled: How can we compare three integers to find which one is bigger or smaller and came up with [math.max](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23547203/how-can-we-compare-three-integers-to-find-which-one-is-bigger-smaller). By definition: [MDN web docts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/max)
* The [required](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_required.asp) specifies that the element must be filled out before submitting the form.
